# OPTIMADE dashboard of known providers

This repository contains the code to generate the dashboard of known providers,
extracted from [https://providers.optimade.org](https://providers.optimade.org).

**In order to see the dashboard, go to [https://www.optimade.org/providers-dashboard/](https://www.optimade.org/providers-dashboard/)**.

The dashboard page is automatically regenerated via scheduled GitHub Actions (individual pages mention the last time the information was fetched).
